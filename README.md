**DeviceLayout** is a Swift framework that lets you set *Auto Layout* constraints's differently for each device

Using only `IBInspector` of Xcode to set up your constant per device size differently without any CODE :)

`@IBInspectable` make a migic with outh any CODE

Only 3 seconds you can set design guide and make designer happy  🚀

```swift
public enum Size: Int, Comparable {
    case unknownSize = 0
    /// iPhone 4, 4s, iPod Touch 4th gen.
    case screen3_5Inch
    /// iPhone 5, 5s, 5c, SE, iPod Touch 5-6th gen.
    case screen4Inch
    /// iPhone 6, 6s
    case screen4_7Inch
    /// iPhone 6+, 6s+, 7, 8
    case screen5_5Inch
    /// iPhone X, Xs, 7+, 8+
    case screen5_8Inch
    /// iPhone Xs
    case screen6_1Inch
    /// iPhone Xr
    case screen6_5Inch
    /// iPad Mini, iPhone Xs Max
    case screen7_9Inch
    /// iPad
    case screen9_7Inch
    /// iPad Pro (10.5-inch)
    case screen10_5Inch
    /// iPad Pro (12.9-inch)
    case screen12_9Inch
}
```
